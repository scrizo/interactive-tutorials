Tutorial
--------

Arrays are special variables which can hold more than one value using the same variable, using an index. Arrays are defined in a very
straightforward syntax:

    /* defines an array of 10 integers */
    int numbers[10];

Accessing a number from the array is done using the same syntax. Notice that arrays in C are zero-based, which means that if we
defined an array of size 10, then the array cells 0 through 9 (inclusive) are defined. `numbers[10]` is not an actual value.

    int numbers[10];

    /* populate the array */
    numbers[0] = 10;
    numbers[1] = 20;
    numbers[2] = 30;
    numbers[3] = 40;
    numbers[4] = 50;
    numbers[5] = 60;
    numbers[6] = 70;

    /* print the 7th number from the array, which has an index of 6 */
    printf("The 7th number in the array is %d", numbers[6]);

Arrays can only have one type of variable, because they are implemented as a sequence of values in the computer's memory.
Because of that, accessing a random array cell is very efficient.

Exercise
--------

* The code below does not compile, because the `grades` variable is missing. 
* One of the grades is missing. Can you define it so the grade average will be 85?

Tutorial Code
-------------

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
      /* TODO: define the grades variable here */
      int average;

      grades[0] = 80;
      /* TODO: define the missing grade
         so that the average will sum to 85. */
      grades[2] = 90;

      average = (grades[0] + grades[1] + grades[2]) / 3;
      printf("The average of the 3 grades is: %d", average);

      return 0;
    }

Expected Output
---------------

    The average of the 3 grades is: 85

Solution
--------

    int main() {
      /* TODO: define the grades variable here */
      int average;
      int grades[3];
      
      grades[0] = 80;
      grades[1] = 85;
      grades[2] = 90;

      average = (grades[0] + grades[1] + grades[2]) / 3;
      printf("The average of the 3 grades is: %d", average);

      return 0;
    }
